# SpaFHy v1.0

This is repository for SpaFHy_v1 source code (under MIT copyright licence).

Launiainen, S., Guan, M., Salmivaara, A., and Kieloaho, A.-J.: Modeling boreal forest evapotranspiration and water balance at stand and catchment scales: a spatial approach, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/23/3457/2019/ 

Contains working examples of catchment scale and point-scale models (with example data).

To run the model:

1) clone repository
2) create folder '/results'
3) change file paths accordingly in spafhy_parameters

4) To run catchment-scale model, see demo_spafhy_C3. append parent folder to sys.path if necessary
5) To run point-scale model, see demo_spafhy_point. append parent folder to sys.path if necessary

Folders:

/data - contains necessary example data

/misc - old and obsolete stuff; may be re-cyclable

/FigsC3 - figures etc.

/results - (create manually!) to store results.

Tested in Py 3.6, should also work with 2.7.
Required packages: os, sys, numpy, pandas, NetCDF4, pickle, scipy, matplotlib, (seaborn for plotting)
Pandas is constantly evolving so depending on version some fixes may be necessary.

Antti: can you check through the codes and required versions of packages. Also, test using 2.7
